# locale

This is a script that gathers from two data sources:

https://github.com/dr5hn/countries-states-cities-database/raw/refs/heads/master/json/countries+states+cities.json

https://www.timeapi.io/api

combined with a list compiled from the official/de-facto languages for all of the nations to derive a compact, 
filtered list of locale data suited to the purposes of a web application.

It does not include cities and states data, only the timezones and languages associated with a country, as is needed 
for web applications.
